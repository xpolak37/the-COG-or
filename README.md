# the COG-or
Package for improving the functional annotation of bacterial genomes, classification of protein-coding sequences into clusters of orthologous groups, and visualization 
of the final annotated genome. The package uses the outputs of the tools that assign COG to protein
coding sequences, namely eggNOG-mapper, Operon-mapper,and Batch CD-Search. The COG-or includes functions to 
process these outputs and improve the annotation. It outputs a new processed file in a suitable format 
that is ready to be visualized in DNAPlotter program.
